📌 Project Tasks & Statistical Analysis
1️⃣ Measure of Central Tendency – Ratings

✔ Calculate

Mean

Median

Mode

❓ Which value best represents the central tendency of app ratings?

2️⃣ Spread of Data – Purchase Amount

✔ Compute:

Range

IQR (Interquartile Range)

❓ How do these values help interpret variability in spending?

3️⃣ Variance & Standard Deviation – Likes

✔ Calculate

Variance

Standard Deviation

❓ What does the standard deviation say about the spread of likes on reviews?

4️⃣ Correlation Between Likes & Ratings

✔ Compute correlation coefficient between:

Number of Likes

Rating Given

❓ Is the relationship positive, negative, or nonexistent?

5️⃣ Distribution of Ratings

✔ Plot a histogram / KDE of app ratings
❓ Is the distribution positively or negatively skewed?
❓ What does this imply about user satisfaction?

6️⃣ Hypothesis Testing – Instagram vs WhatsApp Ratings

Perform a two-sample hypothesis test at 95% confidence level

🎯 Goal:
Determine whether Instagram has a significantly higher average rating than WhatsApp.

7️⃣ Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Demonstration

✔ Take random samples of app ratings
✔ Calculate sample means
✔ Plot the sampling distribution

🎓 Explain how it approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases.
